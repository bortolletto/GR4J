    """Implementation of the Cemaneige + GR4J coupled hydrological model.
    
    This function should be called via the .simulate() function of the 
    CemaneigeGR4J class and not directly. It is kept in a separate file for 
    less confusion if anyone wants to inspect the actual model routine.
    
    The naming of the variables is kept as in the original publication [1] and 
    [2].
    
    Args:
        prec: Numpy [t,n] array, which contains the precipitation for each 
            elevation layer n.
        mean_temp: Numpy [t,n] array, which contains the mean temperature for
            each elevation layer n.
        frac_solid_prec: Numpy [t,n] array, which contains the fraction of 
            solid precipitation for each elevation layer n.
        snow_pack_init: Scalar for the initial state of the snow pack.
        thermal_state_init: Scalar for the initial state of the thermal state.
        params: Numpy array of custom dtype, which contains the model parameter.
        
    Returns:
        outflow: Numpy [t] array, which contains the liquid water outflow for
            each timestep.
        G: Numpy [t] array, which contains the state of the snow pack for 
            each timestep.
        eTG: Numpy [t] array, which contains the thermal state of the snow
            pack for each timestep.
